#Polaris Snapshot

To run the code - clone the repo and run the following command
`meteor`

Then create an account and enter a snapshot for your project. The snapshot is 
a meeting preparation and presentation tool. It has four major sections:
* __This Week I...__ - summary of last week's work
* __From this I learned...__ - Learnings from the work
* __I reflected on...__ - Reflecting on project/metablocker issues of the previous week
* __Moving forward, I will...__ - What the plan for next week of work is

The goal of this tool was to provide a lightweight scaffold for students to prepare 
for meetings and take control of their reflection and goal setting process.
